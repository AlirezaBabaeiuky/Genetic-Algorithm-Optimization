GA is used to find global minimum or maximum points for highly nonlinear problems. A genetic algorithm (GA) is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution. It is evolutionary-based optimization problem.  The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm randomly selects individuals from the current population and uses them as parents to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive and iterative generations, the population "evolves" toward an optimal solution.
Considering the Rastrigin function, genetic evolution path based on the Roulette Wheele is as follows:
